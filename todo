 [x]- implement incremental scanner with extra level of look ahead to check for anonymous function
 [x]   - makeToken_ needs to allocate a new string object if its an identifier (not if its a keyword)
 [x]- decide what to do about statement level anonymous functions: rewind scanner or swap anonymous function symbol to @ or $ -- rewind is nicer!

 [x]- garbage collection
 [x]- undo rewind work. uncaptured executed anon functions are now not supported - consider do block?

 []- for i in 0..10 | ..10 | 0..=9 | 9..-1 | 9..=0
 []- bytecode intermediate format, output/input from file
 []- continue following book from 25.4.4
 []- test for multiple upvalues captured - editing changes all references
 []- while expression
 []- error types - @ catch block after function  -- does return output a value or return from surrounding function?
 []- better internal error management (reified errors)
 []- 
 []- structs / objects

ideas
 []- usage as preprocessor with -pp
 []- simple standard lib:
    - stdin
    - fileio
 []- rest server
 []- c++ interop with abstract classes
