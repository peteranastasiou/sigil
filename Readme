Plan for sigil, where it differs from lox

# Language features
consts
+= operator
continue and break from loops
enforce {} on if. use elif as else <if> is no longer supported.
if-expressions: if used in an expression. Erases last pop from a final expression statement.
                or: only allow one expression-statement in if-expressions?
while-expression
nice switch statement
for loop iterators with yield
multiple return values -- destructuring lists
fake exception-like return "fail" keyword (caught on the function?)
lists
structs (instead of classes?)

# Utilities
auto commandline params
c api
bundling into exe with interpreter
c++ interop
